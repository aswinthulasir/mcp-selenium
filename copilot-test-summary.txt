Observations:
The API correctly enforces validation for required fields and data types.
There is no validation for an empty name field, which might be an oversight if names are expected to be non-empty.
Recommendations:
Add validation to ensure the name field is not empty.
Expand test cases to cover additional scenarios, such as extremely large values for age or special characters in name.
